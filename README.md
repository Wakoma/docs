# Lokal Docs

[Lokal Documentation](https://docs.lokal.network/)

This is a work in progress!

We will be adding information about each of the services offered on [Lokal](https://github.com/Wakoma/Lokal), and how they can be configured, used, and localized by communities around the world.

All services included in the platform operate offline-first.
