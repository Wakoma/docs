The “Free” in FreePBX stands for Freedom. That’s because FreePBX, the world’s most popular open source IP PBX, gives users the tools to build a phone system tailored to their needs.

## Basic Info


The official FreePBX Distro offers the easiest way possible to install and configure an Asterisk-based open source phone system on a server or virtual environment. If you’re ready to experience the freedom of open source communications, follow these simple steps:

    Download the ISO file and burn to a CD or DVD.
    In its BIOS menu, configure the computer that will serve as your FreePBX server to boot from a CD or DVD. 
    Insert the CD or DVD into the computer and turn it on.
    Follow the FreePBX system prompts as it installs and restarts the computer.
    After installation is complete, enter the IP address of the new PBX into a web browser on the same network. This will allow you to create the admin username and password.
    Configure your new IP PBX!
