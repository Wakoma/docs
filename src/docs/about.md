# Introduction to Lokal

## How does Lokal work?

Lokal deploys services via docker-compose files generated and managed by ansible playbooks.

## Why Lokal?

We recognize and understand that there are several other services out there that do similar things. Our motivations for building Lokal stem from a unique set of needs and constraints that emerge from working in low connectivity/no connectivity regions. [NEEDS EXPANSION]
