An Open Source Network Security Monitoring Tool

## Basic Info

Zeek provides a comprehensive platform for network traffic analysis, with a particular focus on semantic security monitoring at scale. While often compared to classic intrusion detection/prevention systems, Zeek takes a quite different approach by providing users with a flexible framework that facilitates customized, in-depth monitoring far beyond the capabilities of traditional systems. With initial versions already in operational deployment during the mid â€˜90s, Zeek finds itself grounded in more than 20 years of research.
